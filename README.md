# ngram modeling

This folder contains 1 file (ngram.py) and 1 folder

ngram.py:

This is the program that contains the code for all three parts of the assignment and everything you need can be printed out. If you want to play with the code or want different outputs all you have to do it add or change the print statements in main.

To run this program:

```
python3 ngram.py
```

The folder contains:

Specifically, `1b_benchmark.train.tokens` is taken from sections 0-9,
`1b_benchmark.dev.tokens` is taken from sections 10 and 11, and
`1b_benchmark.test.tokens` is taken from sections 12 and 13.

To recreate this data (download the raw 1 Billion Word Benchmark and generate the split), run:

```
./subsample_1b_benchmark.sh
```
